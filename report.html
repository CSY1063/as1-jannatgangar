            <h2>Overall Experience</h2>
            <p>I would like to describe my  experience in learning web development , coding, designing and debugging as a fun as well as a little bit stressful task because unlike many other students in the course I had very less experience in coding but still through this website I have tried to portray my best work. The best part of doing web development is getting to learn from Chris. The way he teaches is very enthusiastic plus I really enjoy attending his lecture. I don’t think I’ve missed any of this module’s lecture. When I started my website in week 2, I struggled honestly but as the weeks passed by I think I’ve learnt a lot through this. During this whole website assignment, creating animations, using keyframes has to be the most fun part for me. Overall, this assignment was so fun and it had so much to learn. I really enjoyed every bit of it.</p>

            <h2>My Reflection</h2>
            <p>If I talk about what this module has taught me or what are my reflections towards it, I would say first, the way it has been taught by one and only Chris is outstanding. He made this module so interesting and fun that every Monday I used to travel two hours just to attend this session. Secondly, learning both of the languages i.e HTML and CSS was such a wonderful experience. This assignment built my interest much more in Computer science. Looking forward to learn much more about in future.

            <h2>Hidden Features</h2>
            <p>In this assignment, I have used a contrast of beige and navy blue colour and the reason I used this contrast is once i was scrolling through instagram, I saw a reel which said a combination of navy blue and beige makes a very expensive combo so I used it just give my website a modernised look.
